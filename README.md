# AIII – Looking for a Technical Co-Founder (Builder)

## Project

AIII (AI Independence Index) is a public, reproducible benchmark that ranks AI systems on one single dimension:

their ability to explicitly expose political, economic, cultural, and narrative constraints in their answers.

This is not an ethics project.  
Not a manifesto.  
Not a think tank.

It’s a leaderboard + raw logs, designed to be copyable by anyone.

Performance is irrelevant.  
Independence is observable.

## What already exists

– Clear conceptual framework  
– Defined evaluation logic (questions, rotation, scoring)  
– Strong intuition validated by one signal: silence and avoidance  
– A name, a scope, and a reason to exist  

What does not exist yet is the artifact.

That’s the gap.

## What we want to ship (v0)

A very small but real object:

– A public website  
– A leaderboard (even ugly)  
– A reproducible test run  
– Raw answers publicly accessible  
– A simple scoring grid (explicit, debatable, transparent)  

10 questions.  
3–4 models.  
1 page.

That’s it.

This is meant to be shipped in days, not months.

## Who you are

You are comfortable shipping fast.

You’ve already built MVPs, side projects, benchmarks, dashboards, or tools.

You don’t need permission to deploy.

You are fine with imperfect v0s that exist in public.

Tech stack is open, but typical choices would be:

– Next.js / Supabase / Vercel  
– or Python + simple backend  
– or anything you can ship in days, not months  

You don’t need to agree with the project ideologically.

You need to find it interesting enough to build.

## My role

I’m not a developer.

I do framing, concepts, pressure points, naming, scope, and direction.

I won’t micromanage code.  
I won’t rewrite your commits.  
I won’t turn this into a committee.

You build.  
We ship.  
We iterate.

## Your role

You are a co-founder, not a contractor.

– You own the technical architecture  
– You ship the MVP  
– You co-decide what’s in and what’s out  
– You are publicly listed as co-founder  

Equity discussion is open and honest, based on actual contribution.

This is not a “free work” situation.

## Why this is worth your time

– Immediate public visibility (leaderboards attract attention)  
– A rare benchmark angle (independence, not performance)  
– A project that creates reactions simply by existing  
– A clean, minimal surface that can grow or stop without debt  

If AIII fails, it fails fast and clean.  
If it works, it becomes hard to ignore.

## What to do if interested

No pitch deck.  
No long calls.

Send:

– A short message  
– A link to something you’ve built (GitHub, site, tool, anything real)  

That’s enough.
